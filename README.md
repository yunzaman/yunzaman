Data Analyst | Computer Technician | Lifelong Learner
-----------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone, My name is Yunus, I am a data analyst in training. I have a background in IT, where I worked as a mobile, desktop and laptop technician for over 10 years. This is where I gained invaluable experience in customer service with people of all backgrounds, helping them to experience how to use their tech to enrich their daily lives. This work allowed me to educate customers about their technology as well as repair them. Technology can be daunting for many people. I have picked up skills to provide a helping hand in navigating it from time to time for those who struggle, or feel embarrassed, guiding them to understand their technology in the simplest and easy to understand way, which I hope to bring through with presenting data and sharing a story. I have a solid foundation in technology and a keen interest in science. I'm passionate about finding meaningful insights and solutions from data. I'm currently studying in the data analysis bootcamp with Just IT, where I'm learning how to use various tools and techniques to manipulate, visualize, and interpret data. I have completed several projects using excel, tableau, power bi and mySQL, such as analysing customer behaviour, predicting sales, and creating interactive dashboards. I'm always eager to learn new skills and tools to advance my career into becoming a data scientist. I'm looking for opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and challenges. I believe that every dataset has a story waiting to be told.
